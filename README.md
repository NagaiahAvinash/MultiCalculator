Project Description and Progress Record

App Overview

App Name: MultiCalculator

Developer: Avinash Nagaiah

Student ID: A00227141

Instructor: Brent Richie

Course: MAPD2 (Mobile Application Development)

Subject: Multiplatform Development


Project Description

The MultiCalculator app is a cross-platform calculator application developed as part of the MAPD2 course under the subject of Multiplatform Development. The primary goal of this project is to create a functional calculator that operates on both Android and iOS platforms using Kotlin Multiplatform technology.

The app is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. By leveraging Kotlin's multiplatform capabilities, the MultiCalculator ensures a consistent user experience across different operating systems while sharing a significant portion of the codebase.

Current Progress

Progress Record:

1:Project Initialization: Successfully set up a new Kotlin Multiplatform project named MultiCalculator.


2:Basic Functionality Implementation: Developed the core functionalities of the calculator. This includes:

>An add function to sum two numbers.

>A subtract function to find the difference between two numbers.

>A multiply function to calculate the product of two numbers.

>A divide function to compute the quotient of two numbers, with error handling for division by zero.


3:Calculator Logic and UI Implementation: Implemented the logic and user interface for the calculator, enabling users to perform basic arithmetic operations seamlessly. The UI components include buttons for numbers and operations, a display area for showing results, and layout arrangements for a user-friendly interface.


Future Development

Moving forward, the MultiCalculator project may expand to include more advanced features such as scientific calculations, history of operations, and additional settings for user customization. The focus will also be on optimizing the app for both Android and iOS platforms to ensure seamless performance and user experience.


This document provides a comprehensive overview of the MultiCalculator app, detailing its current status and future development plans. This record is intended to keep track of the project's progress and ensure that all milestones are documented and met as per the course requirements.
